## Challenge: Improving your person
Can you add code to your new person, so that they only appear in room 1? Make sure you test out your new code!



+ You can also add in patrolling enemies, who end the game if the player touches them. Add in a new enemy sprite, and change the rotation style, just like you did with the 'person' sprite.

+ Add code to your enemy, so that they only appear in room 2.

+ You'll also need to add code to move the enemy, and to end the game if the enemy touches the player. It's easier to do this in separate code blocks. Here's how your enemy code should look:

+ Test out your enemy, to make sure that:
	+ It's only visible in room 2;
	+ It patrols the room;
	+ The game ends if the player touches it.
