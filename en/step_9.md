## Challenge: Add an enemy

You could also add in patrolling enemies. If the player touches an enemy, the game ends.

+ Add code to the enemy sprite so that it only appears in room 2.

+ Add code to move the enemy, and to end the game if the enemy touches the player. It's easier to do this in separate code blocks. Here's how your enemy code might look:

+ Test out your enemy, to make sure that:
	+ It's only visible in room 2;
	+ It patrols the room;
	+ The game ends if the player touches it.
