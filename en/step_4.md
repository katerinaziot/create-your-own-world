## Solid walls

+ Test out your player again, and you'll see they have the ability to walk through the light grey walls.

+ To fix this, you need to move the player, but then move them back if they're touching a light grey wall. Here's the code you'll need to add:

	```blocks
		when flag clicked
		forever
			if <key [up arrow v] pressed? > then
				change y by (2)
				if < touching color [#BABABA]? > then
					change y by (-2)
				end
			end
		end
	```

	Notice the new `if`{:class="blockcontrol"} block.

+ Test this new code by moving below the wall - you shouldn't be able to move up into it.

+ Do the same for the left arrow, moving back if the player is touching a wall. This is how your player code should look so far:

+ Add code to your player sprite so that you canâ€™t walk through walls in any direction. Use the code you already have to help you.
