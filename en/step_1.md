## Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to make their own open-world game, making use of all Scratch concepts and skills that have been learnt in previous projects.

## Resources
For this project, Scratch 2 should be used. Scratch 2 can either be used online at [jumpto.cc/scratch-on](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-on) or can be downloaded from [jumpto.cc/scratch-off](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-off) and used offline.

The 'Project Materials' link for this project contains the following resources:

##### Project Resources

For this project, club members can make use of external resources that aren't available in the Scratch library:

+ player.png;
+ room1/2/3.png;
+ sign.svg;
+ chest.svg;
+ person.png;

(The project resources also includes a .zip containing all the resources listed above.)

For club members that aren't able to access these project resources, there is a Scratch project with the external resources pre-loaded. This is available online at [jumpto.cc/world-resources](http://jumpto.cc/world-resources), or in the downloadable project materials, which contains:

+ CreateYourOwnWorldResources.sb2 

## Learning Objectives
+ This project consolidates learning of all programming skills learnt.

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)

## Challenges
+ "Moving in all four directions" - adding up, down, left and right player controls;
+ "Fixing your player's movement" - not allowing the player to move through walls;
+ "Moving to the previous room" - move back 1 room if touching a yellow door;
