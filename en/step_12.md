## Challenge: Create your own world
You can now continue creating your own world. Here are some ideas:

+ Change the setting of your game, and your game graphics;
+ Add sound and music to your game;
+ Add more people, enemies, signs and coins;
+ Add red and yellow doors, that need their own keys to open them;
+ Add more rooms to your world;
+ Add other useful items to your game;

+ Use coins to get information from other people;

+ You could even add north and south doors, so that the player can move between rooms in all 4 directions. For example, if you had 9 rooms, you could think of them as being in a 3x3 grid. You can then add 3 to the room number to move down 1 level.
